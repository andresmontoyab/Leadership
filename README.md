in order to start improve our customer centricity there are three initial steps that can help, intentionality, basically means start thinking about how to impact,
how to give to the customer a better experience, secondly Ownership

Nowadays client wants connections, human moments and personal experiences for this reason is so important listening customer voices, likes and dislikes, if you
want to build relationships, empathy is a must have.

## Economy Expirience

There are four important concepts when we are talking about economy experience:

1. Commodites: a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold
2. Good: A good in economics is any object or product (factors of production) that is useful. Goods are created with Commodites
3. Services: In economics, a service is an economic activity where an immaterial exchange of value occurs. One example of services are order 
lunch to be delivery in your house
4. Experience: It means businesses that orchestrate memorable events for their customers, and that memory itself becomes the product: the "experience".

## Authenticity

In order to achieve experience you must have Authenticy

## Authenticity in terms of Bussiness

1. Dont say you're authentic unless you really are authentic.
2. It is easy to be authentic, if you dont say you're authentic
3. If you say you're authentic you better be authentic

## Authenticity in terms of Consumers

1. What we what we'll make us happy is spending our time and our money satisfatying the desire for authenticity.

# Communication

Communication basically is transfer data, and usually has the prime objective of to make the receiverget your point of view.

## Kind Of Communications

1. Verbal

Something that use the medium of speech. Examples are dialogue, conversation among others

2. Written Communication

This is when the medium is the written word, some example can be email or books

3. Non Verbal

The Verbal and written communication are explicit communication, the non verbal communication is not a explicit one
some examples of non verbal communication are facial expression, tone of speech even the distance at which you stand from the other person.

4. Data Driven Communication

Is where the data has been assemble and presented, and example of this is a graph.

## Effective Strategies

1. Step Approach

The "Step Approach" is basically give the information one step at the time, sometimes we usually use the One Step Approach that basically means
give all the information at once, that maybe can cause some confusion in the receiver, so for this reason the Step Approach is more useful because we can
divide the information and guide the receiver step by step.

2. Inclusive Communication

When we are transfering information we must be inclusive, What inclusive means?, When we are in a team work we have to keep in mind
that every person is different, every person has different level of experiences or even knowledge, for this reason we need to speak/communicate with
the required empathy towards our audience, and that means communicate in way that every team member can understand us, It does not matter their experience or knowledge.

## Effective Structures 

Studies say that people collect structured information 40% better.

1. Past/Present/Future

In this structure we have to take into account the three stages, past, present and future.

In the past we basically point to create a representation of past event, some examples could be 
"What went right?", "What were the previous achievements?" or "What we could be done better".

In the present is important highlight what is the current status of the project/situation(It will be very useful ask for feedback in this step.)

In the future, we need to talk about the incoming task, open question about it.

2. Problem , Solution, Benefit

Categorise your data into the positives, the problems at hand and what needs to be done.

Problem -> What is the problem, Thing that get impacted because of the problem., What is the severity of the problem

Solution -> What are the solutions at hand?, Which Solutions would you choose and why

DonÂ´t just focus on the problems. Give enough importance to solutions too.

You need to prepare the right question to tehn have a good brainstorming session

Benefit -> Why also benefit you and also them.

Always keep it inclusive.

## The other person would want to talk about this if the talk emphasisted is on we rather than I
