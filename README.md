What are the processes, procedures, daily decision and customer services that we made every single day as a employee that is going to have impact on that customer, 
in order to start improve our customer centricity there are three initial steps that can help, intentionality, basically means start thinking about how to impact,

## Economy Expirience

There are four important concepts when we are talking about economy experience:

1. Commodites: a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold
2. Good: A good in economics is any object or product (factors of production) that is useful. Goods are created with Commodites
3. Services: In economics, a service is an economic activity where an immaterial exchange of value occurs. One example of services are order 
lunch to be delivery in your house
4. Experience: It means businesses that orchestrate memorable events for their customers, and that memory itself becomes the product: the "experience".

## Authenticity

In order to achieve experience you must have Authenticy

## Authenticity in terms of Bussiness

1. Dont say you're authentic unless you really are authentic.
2. It is easy to be authentic, if you dont say you're authentic
3. If you say you're authentic you better be authentic

## Authenticity in terms of Consumers

1. What we what we'll make us happy is spending our time and our money satisfatying the desire for authenticity.

# Communication

Communication basically is transfer data, and usually has the prime objective of to make the receiverget your point of view.

## Kind Of Communications

1. Verbal

Something that use the medium of speech. Examples are dialogue, conversation among others

2. Written Communication

This is when the medium is the written word, some example can be email or books

3. Non Verbal

The Verbal and written communication are explicit communication, the non verbal communication is not a explicit one
some examples of non verbal communication are facial expression, tone of speech even the distance at which you stand from the other person.

4. Data Driven Communication

Is where the data has been assemble and presented, and example of this is a graph.

## Effective Strategies

1. Step Approach

The "Step Approach" is basically give the information one step at the time, sometimes we usually use the One Step Approach that basically means
give all the information at once, that maybe can cause some confusion in the receiver, so for this reason the Step Approach is more useful because we can
divide the information and guide the receiver step by step.

2. Inclusive Communication

When we are transfering information we must be inclusive, What inclusive means?, When we are in a team work we have to keep in mind
that every person is different, every person has different level of experiences or even knowledge, for this reason we need to speak/communicate with
the required empathy towards our audience, and that means communicate in way that every team member can understand us, It does not matter their experience or knowledge.

## Effective Structures 

Studies say that people collect structured information 40% better.

1. Past/Present/Future

In this structure we have to take into account the three stages, past, present and future.

In the past we basically point to create a representation of past event, some examples could be 
"What went right?", "What were the previous achievements?" or "What we could be done better".

In the present is important highlight what is the current status of the project/situation(It will be very useful ask for feedback in this step.)

In the future, we need to talk about the incoming task, open question about it.

2. Problem , Solution, Benefit

Categorise your data into the positives, the problems at hand and what needs to be done.

Problem -> What is the problem, Thing that get impacted because of the problem., What is the severity of the problem

Solution -> What are the solutions at hand?, Which Solutions would you choose and why

Don´t just focus on the problems. Give enough importance to solutions too.

You need to prepare the right question to tehn have a good brainstorming session

Benefit -> Why also benefit you and also them.

Always keep it inclusive.

## The other person would want to talk about this if the talk emphasisted is on we rather than I

# Conflict Resolution

What is about conflicts that make it so dificult to solve it?

The most common way to deal with conflict is to avoid it, other just get upset and other just get sick. There is a very clever sign that goes like this 
"De-nile is not a river in Egypt, denial is one of the most common problems when it comes to resolving conflict".

What is a conflict: Conflict exist when one person has a need of another and that need is not beign met.

## Sources of Conflict

There are several sources for a conflict, could be different point of views, problems in the communication between the parties 
or lack of resources, nevertheless deeply there is one reason, "There is a need that is not being supplied."

## Solving Conflicts

When we are solving conflicts is very important always start with the question What is your reason to be updaset?, What is behind the customer positions? or
What are the needs that you have?

All Ideas are good ideas.

Wild ideas are encouraged

Be inspired by ideas

### Win-Win

Creating options that met all parties met.(Create option that supply needs of all the sides)

Steps for negotiations

1. Defining the issue. -> Everyone starts on the same page. Writing a neutral descriptions of the issue. 
2. Exploring needs and concerns -> Start asking to each side, what they need in order to feel the issue is being resolved.
3. Brainstorming options -> In this point we are going to create ideas that could solve the conflict of each side
4. Actions planning -> Wit the previous ideas we are able to produce an actions plan in which everyone agrees.

### Another Strategy

1. Separete the people from the problem
2. Invent options for mutual gain.
3. Insist on using objective Criteria.

## Most Common Tricky Tactics

1. Deliberate deceptions

Consist in misrepresentation of facts, authority and intentions.

* What to do ?

In this scenario we should focus in the problems instead of the people

2. Psychological warfare

In order to win the negotiation over you, the other party may try to make feel uncomfortable using tactics that we will refer to a psychological warfare,
they will try to create stressful situations like trying to manipulate where the meeting is going to happend for example, they will try it to have in their territory,
so then they feel in control. 

* What do to?

Raise the Issue explicitly

3. Positional Pressure Tactics

This are use to structure the situation when only one side can make consecions, some of them refuse to negotiate.

* What to do ?	

Recognize the tactic as posible negotiation.
Do not attack them for refuse to negotiate, but rather find out intersting why they are not negotiating and suggest some options

# Negotiation

Separete the people from the problem.

Focus on interests, not positions

Invent options for mutual gain.

Use Objective Criteria


BATNA - Best Alternative to a negotiated agreements.

Every people negotiate in differente ways.

## Positive No

No, must have a positive No., in order to create positive no , you can follow the next steps.

## Different Styles Negotiation

1. Hard Styles
 
this style depends on taking position, both parties hold on to a fixed idea. Convincing and forcing the other side, in this case one side win and the 
other loses

Unconstructive and inefftive

Trust is broken

Relationships will be damaged

2. Soft Styles

Being eager to please.

One side needs to reach an agreement and build an maintain the relationship

One side makes offers and concessions, changing their position easily in order to reac an agreement and avoid confrontation.

Problem solved in the short term, but the conflic remains unsolved. 

When you use it constantly make you vulnerable to someone who plays a hard game

3. Win-Win

Separate people from problems. -> Face the problem no t the people.

Dont focus on positions, focus on interests and needs

Generate options for mutual gain. Give yourself the opportunity to think out of the box and create more options to make better agreements

Develop objective criteria. -> Avoid sharing your data as if you had the truth
