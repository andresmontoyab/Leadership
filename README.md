# Customer Centricity

What are the processes, procedures, daily decision and customer services that we made every single day as a employee that is going to have impact on that customer, 
in order to start improve our customer centricity there are three initial steps that can help, intentionality, basically means start thinking about how to impact,
how to give to the customer a better experience, secondly Ownership 

1. Intentionality: thinking about how to impact, how to give to the customer a better experience.
2. Ownership
3. Do something about it.
 
## Connections

Nowadays client wants connections, human moments and personal experiences for this reason is so important listening customer voices, likes and dislikes, if you
want to build relationships, empathy is a must have.

## Economy Expirience

There are four important concepts when we are talking about economy experience:

1. Commodites: a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold
2. Good: A good in economics is any object or product (factors of production) that is useful. Goods are created with Commodites
3. Services: In economics, a service is an economic activity where an immaterial exchange of value occurs. One example of services are order 
lunch to be delivery in your house
4. Experience: It means businesses that orchestrate memorable events for their customers, and that memory itself becomes the product: the "experience".

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/progression-economy.PNG) 

## Authenticity

In order to achieve experience you must have Authenticy

## Authenticity in terms of Bussiness

1. Dont say you're authentic unless you really are authentic.
2. It is easy to be authentic, if you dont say you're authentic
3. If you say you're authentic you better be authentic

## Authenticity in terms of Consumers

1. What we what we'll make us happy is spending our time and our money satisfatying the desire for authenticity.

# Communication

Communication basically is transfer data, and usually has the prime objective of to make the receiverget your point of view.

## Kind Of Communications

1. Verbal

Something that use the medium of speech. Examples are dialogue, conversation among others

2. Written Communication

This is when the medium is the written word, some example can be email or books

3. Non Verbal

The Verbal and written communication are explicit communication, the non verbal communication is not a explicit one
some examples of non verbal communication are facial expression, tone of speech even the distance at which you stand from the other person.

4. Data Driven Communication

Is where the data has been assemble and presented, and example of this is a graph.

## Effective Strategies

1. Step Approach

The "Step Approach" is basically give the information one step at the time, sometimes we usually use the One Step Approach that basically means
give all the information at once, that maybe can cause some confusion in the receiver, so for this reason the Step Approach is more useful because we can
divide the information and guide the receiver step by step.

2. Inclusive Communication

When we are transfering information we must be inclusive, What inclusive means?, When we are in a team work we have to keep in mind
that every person is different, every person has different level of experiences or even knowledge, for this reason we need to speak/communicate with
the required empathy towards our audience, and that means communicate in way that every team member can understand us, It does not matter their experience or knowledge.

## Effective Structures 

Studies say that people collect structured information 40% better.

1. Past/Present/Future

In this structure we have to take into account the three stages, past, present and future.

In the past we basically point to create a representation of past event, some examples could be 
"What went right?", "What were the previous achievements?" or "What we could be done better".

In the present is important highlight what is the current status of the project/situation(It will be very useful ask for feedback in this step.)

In the future, we need to talk about the incoming task, open question about it.

2. Problem , Solution, Benefit

Categorise your data into the positives, the problems at hand and what needs to be done.

Problem -> What is the problem, Thing that get impacted because of the problem., What is the severity of the problem

Solution -> What are the solutions at hand?, Which Solutions would you choose and why

Don´t just focus on the problems. Give enough importance to solutions too.

You need to prepare the right question to tehn have a good brainstorming session

Benefit -> Why also benefit you and also them.

Always keep it inclusive.

## The other person would want to talk about this if the talk emphasisted is on we rather than I

# Conflict Resolution

What is about conflicts that make it so dificult to solve it?

The most common way to deal with conflict is to avoid it, other just get upset and other just get sick. There is a very clever sign that goes like this 
"De-nile is not a river in Egypt, denial is one of the most common problems when it comes to resolving conflict".

What is a conflict: Conflict exist when one person has a need of another and that need is not beign met.

## Sources of Conflict

There are several sources for a conflict, could be different point of views, problems in the communication between the parties 
or lack of resources, nevertheless deeply there is one reason, "There is a need that is not being supplied."

## Solving Conflicts

When we are solving conflicts is very important always start with the question What is your reason to be upset?, What is behind the customer positions? or
What are the needs that you have?

All Ideas are good ideas.

Wild ideas are encouraged

Be inspired by ideas

### Win-Win

Creating options that met all parties requirements.(Create option that supply needs of all the sides)

Steps for negotiations

1. Defining the issue. -> Everyone starts on the same page. Writing a neutral descriptions of the issue. 
2. Exploring needs and concerns -> Start asking to each side, what they need in order to feel the issue is being resolved.
3. Brainstorming options -> In this point we are going to create ideas that could solve the conflict of each side
4. Actions planning -> Wit the previous ideas we are able to produce an actions plan in which everyone agrees.

### Another Strategy

1. Separete the people from the problem
2. Invent options for mutual gain.
3. Insist on using objective Criteria.

## Most Common Tricky Tactics

1. Deliberate deceptions

Consist in misrepresentation of facts, authority and intentions.

* What to do ?

In this scenario we should focus in the problems instead of the people

2. Psychological warfare

In order to win the negotiation over you, the other party may try to make you feel uncomfortable using tactics that we will refer to a psychological warfare,
they will try to create stressful situations like trying to manipulate you where the meeting is going to happend for example, they will try it to have in their territory,
so then they feel in control. 

* What do to?

Raise the Issue explicitly

3. Positional Pressure Tactics

This are use to structure the situation when only one side can make connecions, some of them refuse to negotiate.

* What to do ?	

Recognize the tactic as posible negotiation.
Do not attack them for refuse to negotiate, but rather find out intersting why they are not negotiating and suggest some options

# Negotiation

In almost every situation in our life we are going face negotations, and in order to improve this process there are certain strategies and skills
that are going to help us to get what we want and also keeping a strong and truly relationship with the other parties.

## Framework Agreement

It is really important to have a framework agreement and use it as a guide in order to define your goals.

The Framework Agreement is about creating SMART Goals.

SMART stands for:

*. S: Specific
*. M: Measurable
*. A: Achievable
*. R: Realistic
*. T: Time Bound

## Positive No

The word "no" is very important and also critical in order to get to the right yes, or the smart yes.

We can turn a "no" into a "positive no", following the next steps.

1. First start with a yes, a yes in which you said what is truly important to you.
2. After that proceed with a no, a very clear respectful no, neutral.
3. Finally create a constructive positive proposal.

## Different Styles Negotiation

### Hard Styles
 
This style depends on taking position, both parties hold on to a fixed idea. Convincing and forcing the other side, in this case one side win and the 
other loses

Disavantages with this approach:

1. Unconstructive and inefftive

2. Trust is broken

3. Relationships will be damaged

### Soft Styles

This style basically means that one side makes offers and concessions, changing their position easily in order to create an agreement and avoid confrontation.

Disavantages with this approach:

1. When you use it constantly make you vulnerable to someone who plays a hard game

2. Problem solved in the short term, but the conflic remains unsolved. 

3. One side needs to reach an agreement and build an maintain the relationship

### Win-Win Style

Win-Win to an negotation strategy in which both parties are getting what they want. This strategy is based in four statements:

1. Separate people from problems.

2. Dont focus on positions, focus on interests and needs

3. Generate options for mutual gain. Give yourself the opportunity to think out of the box and create more options to make better agreements

4. Develop objective criteria.

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/win-win.PNG) 

## Negotiation Skills

### Listen Actively

What IS Listen Actively?

1. Identify the problem
2. Understand their motives and interests
3. To explore options and listen to the other side objective criteria

What IS NOT Listen Actively?

1. IS NOT Shutting up and thinking about your next response
2. IS NOT being silent to avoid conflict
3. IS NOT a strategy to let the other side talk so you can identify their weaknesses

### Direct Communication

Being Straightforward and clear in your communication is critical, you need to improve your ability to communicate effectively in order to build trust with
the other side.

What IS Direct Communication?

1. Clear Ideas
2. Accurate and precise
3. Aware of your words
4. Two-way process

What IS NOT Direct Communication?

IS NOT promise something you cant deliver
IS NOT threatening
IS NOT Lying

## BATNA 

Avoid a bad business deal.

Develop a batna (Best alternative to a negotiated agreement) is critical for the success of your negotiating

Batna is always about exploring alternatives.

If you're selling the batna is the lowest that you will aceppt.

If you're buying is the highest price that you will pay.

In other words the batna protects you from making bad decisions

### Develop BATNA

1. Determine your available options

2. Improve your best ideas and transform it into alternatives.

Some faact that you should take into account when you're selecting your alternatives are : cost, feasibility, pros and crons

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/batna.PNG) 

## Planning your negotations

### Preparation of the negotation

Most important steps:

What do you need to do:

1. Research -> Gather information about the players.

2. Identify -> Set your objectives clearly

3. Analyze -> Assesss your strengths and risks

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/planning-negotiation.PNG) 

# Risk Management

Risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a negative impact on project's objectives such as time, cost, quality, team motivation and so on. It is 
very important to know that is there is no uncertainty is not a risk, it is a problem that need to be solved ASAP.

## Risk Management Benefits.

1. Improved capacity to manage project.

2. Enhanced communication.

3. Lead to an improved culture of awareness and understanding.

4. Better Alignment of project and organization risks.

5. Empowerment of project teams enabling them to accept responsabilities for risk management.

## Risk Identifications

Risk identification is the process of determining risks that could potentially prevent the project from achieving its objectives.

There are multiples sources of risk, for risks identification the project team should review the scope, cost estimates, delivery schedule, 
performance challenges,  stakeholder expectations vs current plan, implementation challenges, integrations, release process and so on.

Risk identification is an iterations process, as the development progresses more information will be gain, also new risks will be identified as the project progresses to the life cycle.

Risk identification is done entire team, not only the leaders.

### Risk Dimensions /SWOT

1. Helpful / Harmfull

This is a simple assessment of factors that have a potentially positive or negative influence on the success of our project.

Helpful -> Advances the objectives of the project

Harmnful -> Put in danger the outcome of the project

2. Identification of the source.

Internal -> Factors originated inside of the organization or within this field of influence of the project

External -> Factors originated outside of the organization that can not usually be influence by the project.


![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/risk-management.PNG)

Usually Weaknesses are factor that we could have under control, some examples are:

1. Insufficient resources.
2. Limited budget.
3. Aggressive timeline
4. Lack of important skills.
5. Technical uncertainties.
6. Lack of stakeholder consensus.
7. Third party dependencies.

In the other hand Threats are factor in where we dont have control, some examples of Threats are:

1. Changes in the economy.
2. Pandemics.
3. Geopolitical Tensions.
4. Economic uncertainty.
5. Changing lesgislations.
6. Changing competitive landscape.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment & clasification is necessary in order to start analyzing root causes and plan actions.

Each risk need to be categorized as to the affected area, likely hood and level of impact that may have in the project.

### Affected Areas:

1. Cost.
2. Scope.
3. Client Satisfactions.
4. Legal contracts.
5. Deployment.
6. Staffing.
7. Quality Control.
8. Performance 

## Probability & Impact Measures.

Different types of risk management plans can deal with calculating the probability of an event, and how that event might impact you and how to mitigate the problems
associate with those risks. Having a plan helps to deal with adverse situations when they arises and hopefully, headthem off before they arise. 

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/probability-vs-impact.PNG)

### Exposure Matrix

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/exposure-matrix.PNG)

Those areas in read are the ones with major risks exposure. The team should focus in those areas and define mitigations actions for them or resolution plan which will tend   
to avoid or reduce the posible impact on the project.

## Risk Response

Do the difficult, risky stuff front, applying the "Fail Early" strategy

### Mitigations

Is a group of actions to applied before the risk happens in order to reduce the impact in the project.

### Prevention

Take actions to reduce the probability.

### Monitoring 

Take actions to build leading indicator for early detections

### Transfer

Take actions delegate or escalate.

### Accept

Take actions to communicate. 

# Mentoring

You don't need to be perfect in order to be an effective mentor, as a mentor you teach both skills and character.

You should only mentor a person who is ready, willing, and able to grow.

Look for a FAT person:

1. Faithful. 
2. Availabl. 
3. Teacheable.

## 4 Step Process

The 4 Step process is a strategy to start the guidance for the mentee.

1. I do the task, you watch and learn.
2. We do the task together.
3. You do the task and I watch and I offer feedback.
4. You do the task.

## Mentoring vs Coaching

### Coaching

1. Guidance
2. Encouragement.
3. Support

Coaching Skills

1. Presence.
2. Listening.
3. Powerful questioning.
4. Effective Feedback

### Mentoring Skills

Mentoring is define as a one-one relationship between a less experience person and a more experience person, like coaching it is intend to adressed the proffesional
development of the individual.

The difference between mentoring and coaching is that mentoring focuses in on sharing knowledge and experiences with the mentee to help them develop 
increase knowledge.

To be effective as a manager who develops people, the manager needs to know when to coach (when to ask) and when to mentoring(when to tell).

One day of mentoring can change a life forever.!

## Notes

What happens when we failed?

1. Stay down.
2. Return
3. Grow - Learn

Unfortanly we dont leave ourself open about what can come in the future, and trying to minimize pain can cause long term pain.

Learning Cycle.

Try - Fail - Learn - Grow

Every tried, every fail no matter, try again, fail again, fail better.

A mentor is somebody who comes and meet us what we are.

1. Open & Comfortable

Open to posibilities, they see the world as an expansive exciting curious place, there are comfortable in their own skin, 
they're Comfortable being the wrong person and as a result they dont have a plan for your life, they dont try to manipulate you,
they dont try to control you, they want you be comfortable in your skin.

2. They are more interest in what is going internally that externally, mentoring understand that what happends inside of you, and how 
your character develops, that will one day be outside of you.

3. The tend to be able to celebrate the rights, but also to fall, and they'll sit with you in the fall, the dissapointment and heart break.

What a mentor really does, they bringing to the learning cycle again and again, until you become very used to it. 

The mentor is not the only responsable of the mentoring, the main role is the mentee, they have to be avaialble, teacheable and also is very
important for the mentee that they define the goals is where they want to improve. 

### Mentee

1. Available.
2. Know what you want to learn.
3. Teachable.
4. Ideally Mentee must apply/implement the new knowledge

Questions to help your mentee form goals.

1. Where do I want to be?
2. What do I want to be known for?
3. What do I stand for?
4. How do I want to make a difference?


### Mentor

1. Mentors are critical.
2. Challenge the mentee.
3. Explore what they want.
4. Speed up they development.
5. Identy target for your mentee.
6. Focus on measurable goals.

# Leading Teams

Great Leaders put the people first.

We call them leader because they go first, we called them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else.

1. Give Opportunities
2. Give Educations
3. Give Safety

Three Steps to improve anything that you want to do better?

1. Know thyselft -> most people overestimated they talent. You have to take responsability for learning the truth about your self. 
2. Pick one thing to work on.
3. Practice Daily

What is important for your team -> Ask! 

Build trust.

## Working across culture.

Perception -> People see what they want to see, I dont always see what you see.

Culture -> A system of behaviour that helps us act in an accepted or familiar way.

There are expression in every culture that can sounds offensive to other cultures, but that does not mean that they want to be disrespectuful, it is just 
another way to express ideas.

Ideally our purpose when we work across culture is Create global mindset.

## Empowering your team.

Set direcition, and get out of the way.

Set goals to your teams, also you need to accept that are different ways to do it.

Set Goal -> Trust in your team, they can achievete -> they could have better ways to learn.

Beign a good leader aims that even if you're not present your team is going to be indepent.

## Faciliting Effecient Meetings

1. Each meeting shoould have a clear purpose.

2. Time, how long should the meeting be. ("The shorter, the better")

3. Agenda, step by step outline for the meeting.

4. Preparation, prepare their questions.

5. Focus, stay engage in the meeting, avoid multi-tasking.

6. Leadership, every meeting must has the meeting leader, in order to make the previous 5 principles real.

# Team Coordination

1. Be aware in which stage you are as a team.

2. Identify and use your teammates' talents.

3. Develop compelling purpose

4. Share and live a culture.

5. Make agreements and commitments

6. Develop accountability

## Large or Multiple Teams

Micromanaging has a negative impact on you and on yor team. 

* Overloaded by work.

* Extra pressure

 Little time to focus

### Delegation.

Assigning the task the authority and the responsability.

There are some problems with the delegation:

1. Usually we feel the need of controlling everything.

2. We are risk averse, and we think that delegate the task to another person could involve to taking an unnecesary risk

3. We believe that the quality of the outcome won't be at the same high standard that It would be if we do it ourselfs.

4. Explaining the task will take longer that completely by ourselves(*)

5. We don't trust the team and our colleagues. 

If you're leading a team and you have a one problem delegating task, please stop and start to implement new actions to overcome these obstacules and delegate 
to your team.

Tips:

1. Identify Talents and interest in your team.

2. Give an extra assignment

3. Delegate tasks and also responsabilities.

4. Follow up, work with the team in the assignment.

5. Instead of criticising(*) for the desicion they make, empower the team to make good decisions.

Delegation is the key when you have to deal with large teams, gives you times to focus on priorities and also is important
to empower, develop and motived your team.

### Power Of conversation

1. Chat with your team

2. Build a team culture.

3. Develop trust.

4. Put humanity where there is a screen

# Proactivity and Thinking out of the box.

## Proactive

Being Proactive is taking intentional action to influence your situation or the environment.

Being Proactive is not a mood is a midset:

1. Taking responsability.

2. Determine Your choices

3. Act independently.

# Release Management

Continuos Delivery is the continual delivery of code to an environment once the developer feels the code is ready to ship. 
This could be UAT or Staging or could be Production, but the idea is you are delivering code to a user base, whether it be a QA or 
customer for continual review and inspection.

Continuos Deployment is the deployment or release of code to production as soon as it is ready. There is no large batching in 
staging nor long UAT process that is directly before production.

![](https://github.com/andresmontoyab/Leadership/blob/master/resources/cd-cd.PNG)

## Release Approach

### Define a regular release cycle.

A team should define a release cycle and get stick to it. With focus on the goal of add value to the customeras soon as a 
new functionality is ready.

### Establish a branching strategy.

In our daily projects is very important to have a well defined branching strategy, thats because it is going to help us
to control the versions of our application and to work with big teams in the same application, one common branching strategy
is the next:

Where:

1. master -> Is the main branch of the application, in where we are going to have our latest stable versions

2. hotfix -> If a bug appears we are to create a new hotfix branch that is going to be copy of master and in that
new branch we are going to solve the bug.

3. develop -> Is the branch from where the new features are going to be created, let's say that every sprint we update develop
with all the sprint changes, but is not require that we update every sprint master.

4. release -> After we achieved a milestone, we can create a new release, basically a release is a new version of the application
in where some new features were added.

5 feature -> Feature are the new updates that are being generated for the application

Some examples are:

1. Jenkins.

2. Bamboo.

3. Github

4. Bitbucket
